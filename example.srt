1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,950
What happened to the pub is
Irish business.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,460
Shut your gypsy mouth
and listen to your
instructions.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,500
Eamonn Duggan?

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,970
My son and my daughter were
taken from me when they were
very small.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,450
We're planning an expansion.
I'm taking premises in London.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,530
The Italian gangs and the Jewish
gangs have been at war in
London.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,250
The Jews have had the worst of
it. They need allies.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,220
We take the opportunity
to show our hand.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,450
That arrived an hour ago.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,010
There's no name on it,
but it comes from Camden Town.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,450
Well done, Tommy.
Now you're at war with Sabini.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,300
~ Ada Shelby? ~ No.
~ Your brother broke the rules.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,570
Sabini.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,500
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,460
See if the bastard's still
alive.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,770
♪ Please don't reproach me

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,250
♪ For, for how empty

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,370
♪ My life has become

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,370
♪ I don't know what really
happened

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,450
♪ I watched your disappointment
